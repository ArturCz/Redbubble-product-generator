# Redbubble-product-generator
The plan is to create a product generator for Redbubble. It should extract trending tags/products from Redbubble, transfer this data to ChatGPT to generate catchy phrases, then utilize another AI to generate images. Finally, all of these files will be saved in a folder for easy selection, with letter selection possibly being automatic.
